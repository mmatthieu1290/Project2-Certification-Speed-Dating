## Overview

Project2-Certification-Speed-Dating is a data analysis toolkit that explores the factors influencing partner matching in speed dating scenarios. It leverages dataset exploration, visualization, and statistical insights to reveal behavioral patterns and biases.

**Why Project2-Certification-Speed-Dating?**

This project aims to deepen understanding of human pairing behaviors through data-driven analysis. The core features include:

- **üß©** **Data Exploration & Visualization:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks to visualize relationships and distributions within the dataset.
- **üîç** **Insightful Analysis:** Examines how attributes like attractiveness, fun, and race impact match probabilities.
- **üéØ** **Bias Detection:** Highlights biases and key determinants influencing partner selection.
- **üõ†Ô∏è** **Support for Modeling:** Provides foundational insights to inform further modeling or deployment efforts.
- **üìä** **Behavioral Pattern Recognition:** Facilitates understanding of decision-making processes in social interactions.

## Summary of the study

- The age difference negatively influences the probability of a match.

- Individuals seem more interested in younger people.

- The race of the partners seems to influence the probability of the match.

- Among the attributes, the attractiveness variable is the most decisive in making the decision whether or not to want to see the partner again. The variable being fun is also very important, and we observe that even conditional on the variable of attractiveness, the variable "fun" continues to have a great influence on decision-making (this means that even if the partner is considered attractive, it is expected to be interesting). The other attribute variables seem to have little influence on the decision conditional on the attractiveness variable, even if the intelligence and sincerity variables seem to play a discriminating role among individuals well assessed in attractiveness.

- The attribute variables all seem to be influenced by the attractiveness variable, which shows a very important bias.
